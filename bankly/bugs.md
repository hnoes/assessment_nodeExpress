Bug #1

The sequelize 'authenticate' method is asynchronous, but the code doesn't await its completion, leading to potential issues with the database connection. 

Test to Catch the Bug: 
it('should connect to the database successfully', async function()
    await expect(sequelize.authenticate()).resolves.not.toThrow();
    });


Fix for the code:
(async () => {
    try {
        await sequelize.authenticate();
        console.log('connection has been established successfully.');
    } catch (err) {
        console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', err);
    }
})();


Bug #2 

The 'sequelize' instance is not being used throughout the application. It needs to be passed to the models or other components that require database interaction. 

Test to Catch the Bug: 

it('should use the sequelize instance in models', function() {
    expect(require('./models/someModel).sequelize).toBe(sequelize);
});


Fix for the Code: 
Ensure that you ass the 'sequelize' instance to the models or other components that require it. 


Bug #3 

The 'client' in 'db.js' is exported directly, allowing external modules to manipulate the database connection directly.

Test to Catch the Bug: 

it('should not export client directly in db.js', function () {
    const dbClient = require('./db');
    expect(dbClient).not.toBeInstanceOf(Client);
});

Fix for the Code:

Instead of exporting the 'client' directly, export functions or methods that interact with the database. 

Bug #4

In the '/login' route, the 'User.authenticate' function is not awaited, which may lead to incorrect behavior. 

Test to Catch Bug: 

it('should await User.authenticate in login route', async function () {
    const response = await request(app).post('/auth/login').send({username: 'testuser', password: 'testpassword' });
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body.token).toBeDefined();
});

Fix for the Code: 

Make sure to await the 'User.authenticate' function:

let user = await User.authenticate(username, password);

Bug #5: 

In the '/login' route, if incorrect username/password is given, there is a missing error handling for unauthorized access (status 400).

Test to Catch Bug: 

it('should return 401 for incorrect username/password in login route;, async function () {
    const response = await request(app).post('/auth/login').send({ username: 'invaliduser', password: 'invalidpassword' });
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(401);
});

Fix for the Code: 
Throw an error or return a 401 status when authentication fails. 


Bug #6:

In the 'GET' method, there is a missing 'throw' statement before creating a new instance of 'ExpressError' 

//Tests bug #7
it ('should throw 404 if user is not found in get method', async function () {
    try {
        await User.get('nonexistentuser');
    } catch (error) {
        expect(error.status).toBe(404);
        expect(error.message).toBe('User doesn't exist!'); 
    }
});

Fix for the code: 
if(!user) {
    throw new ExpressError("User doesn't exist", 404);
}
